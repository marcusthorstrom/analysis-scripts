# Analysis scripts

## For running analysis

### Install python
We recomand that you activate a virtual environment before.

```bash
sh python_install.sh
```

### Install docker
```bash
sh docker_install.sh
```

### Run docker

Warning, this script is also killing the container berfore restart. So you need to do it once.
```bash
sh docker_run.sh
```

### Create the database

Connect to phpmyadmin and you have to create a database with the same name as in the .env file.

### Update .env file

yeah...you have to update it.

```bash
# firebase vars
READ_API_URL='https://your_project.cloudfunctions.net/export_json'
READ_TOKEN=''

#docker containers
MYSQL_PORT=3306
PHPMYADMIN_PORT=9000
DOCKER_COVID_MYSQL="docker.covid.mysql"
DOCKER_COVID_ADMIN="docker.covid.phpmyadmin"

# point to your dataset repo
PUBLIC_DATASETS_REPO_RELATIVE_PATH='../datasets'

# other vars
DATABASE_NAME=covid_dev

# your country geocoding file 
GEOCODING_RAW_FILE_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch-covid-19/geo-locations/master/data/mex/MEX_geocoding.csv"
```


### Run the scripts

Run those scripts only once for initialization:

```bash
python analysis/scripts/01_init_db.py
python analysis/scripts/02_upload_geo_data.py
```

Run those scripts when you want to update database.

To upload new data:

```bash
# in case of access to API
python analysis/scripts/03_download_report.py
```

```bash
# in case of not access to API
# then ask for a sample datasets
# that you can load with this script
# the dataset should be put in:
# - backup/documents/<whatever>/<file.json>
python analysis/scripts/90_reload_db_from_json.py
```

To run analysis:

```bash
python analysis/scripts/05_script_analysis.py
```

To run export to csv:

```bash
python analysis/scripts/06_export_csv.py
```

To run export to geocoding:
```bash
# need to be done only if change in geo location
python analysis/scripts/90_export_geocoding.py
```

## For backups

### Create a backup of NOW
```bash
sh docker_db_backup.sh
```

### Relaod a backup
```bash
sh docker_db_restore.sh <relative path to the backup>
# example
sh docker_db_restore.sh backups/sql/covid.sql 
```
